Vuitton is one of the world's leading international fashion houses; it sells its products through standalone boutiques,
lease departments in high-end department stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website.For six consecutive 
years (2006â€“2012) Louis Vuitton has been named the world's most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was 25.9 
billion.The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris, France.Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked and in 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-bottom trunks with trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water run off, and thus could not be stacked.</p></ul>
